The following GUI is able to play and pause any video (in format .mp4 or .mkv) and can perform some operations.
When the application starts we can see a few options:

First, we must choose any video from our computer using the ‘Select Video’ button.
The video will then play and we can choose to take the following actions

One is using the convert button which will change the resolution and/or the format of our video by choosing them with the respective dropdown buttons (imported from exercise 1).
